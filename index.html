	"I won't say too much, but would I will say is how great of a movie this is. One of the best films ever to be produced in anime history. If you just saw "Your Name" and thought wow what a great movie, you should look into Shinkai's next masterpiece of Weathering with You. The interactions between characters are pretty heartfelt and give the audiences a chance a connect to the story. The plot has you guessing all sorts of things and although it may seem straightforward,  this film gives off a huge variety of aspects that you may not have even seen before in any other movies. By far, this film has one of the greatest soundtracks of all time and the music will definitely cause chills throughout your body. Overall this was a great movie, good story, characters, music, and much more. I highly recommend those who haven't watched it to do so."</td>

		"4 years on, and this movie is still wedged in my heart. 
I see reviews here trying to describe this movie. A romcom about two teenagers and an interesting ability to swap bodies at any time within a week. They both grow to love each other as they live in the other's lives. However, there is nothing I could do to replicate or try to explain what I really experienced out of the 6 times I've watched this film. The artwork is without a doubt stunning, the prettiest animation I've seen across any medium. The music is heartfelt, melancholic, inscribed into my heart and brain. I could skip to any part of the movie and hum the OST accurately. Not to mention the 4 incredibly moving and addictive songs - Yumetouru, Zen Zen Zense, Sparkle and Nandemonaiya. Each of these 4 have their own unique sound, with beautifully written lyrics that paint a fantastical picture in my mind every time I listen to them. 
The movie's theme of destiny, fate, and longing for someone may not be new, but it was executed perfectly. Its atmosphere and mood placed me in a space where I didn't know existed. Everything felt so dreamy, out of this world, so astronomical, yet, so attainable. 

But, like I said. I could never replicate and regurgitate my feelings, my experience, when I watched Taki and Mitsuha struggling beautifully in this film. So, go and watch it</td>

		"First time reviewing and speaking but I recently broader my horizon on anime I've watch almost as many movies of studio Ghibli I could find or buy, a silent voice was probably one of the best films animated I've seen, just by the sheer impact you feel I was expecting a sad ending what that 2 hr and 5 minutes movie showed me will forever change my life. The fact this movie is only a 4.9 is bizarre. I loved it I'd give it a 10/10 with the character development and sho and shoko relationship throughout the film I wasn't expecting the near ending the scene where I almost jump out of my seat because I was so scared for the mc. All I can say if I could recommend this to at least 1 person it would be an successful endeavour for promoting such an amazing film.. I've watch 2 times the Japanese and the dub and both feel different but same because each version brings something else with the voices and it is profoundly grateful to hear the difference I'm just happy this is a film. I will always cherish this opportunity to watch a true work of art"</td>
